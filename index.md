#### [Cycle-GAN VC2](https://github.com/gvsakash/cycle-gan/): 
* Deployed GAN models with modified convolution layers, loss functions using PyTorch & Kubeflow. Scaled to Linux-based DL AMI on AWS and achieved improved resolution and de-hazing.
* Designed a version harnessing lesser compute power. Submitted a test version of TF.js upon Swift and proposed suggested directions & publication ideas.
* Explored VC2 applications, for parallel voice conversions and studied fine-tuning of layers. Presented white paper to Prof. Liu and two seminar sessions. 
* **Keywords** (GANs, CNN, Pytorch, Kubeflow, AWS AMI, CUDA, Docker). Final Report: **[*here*](https://github.com/gvsakash/cycle-gan/blob/master/files/cyc-gan.pdf)**

#### [WikiData Parsing and Fakes Detection](github.com/gvsakash/nlp)
* Delivered two projects, based on Bengio models for text parsing and Fakes Detection across Brown & Wiki Data corpora.
* Developing n-gram models and text parsing modules in Wiki articles and reviews, supported with dynamical evauations.
* Using pretrained ResNets & harnessed BERT for word-piece tokenization and  NLU evaluation.
* **Keywords** (nltk, BeautifulSoup, TF, SQL, encoder-decoder, Neural Nets, BERT, Pytorch, Fakes detection)

#### [Chicago PD Analytics:](https://github.com/blainerothrock/cpdp-wise-lobsters)
* Course project done working with the Invisible Institute's CPDP dataset. Explored misconduct and allegation patterns in officer careers' and repeater influence over time. 
* Research and analysis done with PostgreSQL queries, Trifacta (data cleaning/wrangling) and Spark (ML)
* Parsed text data from documents with LDA / topic modeling to study the underlying scale of violence.
* Visualizations and network graphs have been developed in D3.js, Tableau. [[Report](ms/cpdb.pdf)]
* Also used DataBricks for integrating other complaints & officer-registry datasets to validate the results.
* **Keywords** (Postrgesql, Graph Analytics, Machine Learning, gensim, Python, text-document-parsing)
